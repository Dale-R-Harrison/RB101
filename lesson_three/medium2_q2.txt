The outer ids will not change when the objects are passed into the method. So the inital ids for both the outer and inner objects will be the same. 

After reassignment inside the method the objects inside the method will have new ids. THe objects outside the method are unchanged and have their original ids. 

Finally the variable defined inside the method are inaccessible and trying to use them will require the program to rescue from exception and put "ugh ohh'"
