1)
Given two integers.

create a variable, result.
sum both integers, saving sum to result.

START

#Given two integers

SET result = integer_one * integer_two

2) Given array of strings
create an variable, string.
iterating through each element of the array
  add the element to the end of the space (should I add a space delimiter between each?)
return string

START

# Given an array of strings called "strings"

SET iterator = 0
SET string = ""

WHILE iterator < length of strings
  SET string = string + (index of strings that is == iterator)
  iterator = iterator + 1

READ string

3) Given an array of integers

Create an empty array, called new_array
Iterating through each element of given array
  Use a variable to keep track of iterations
  Every other iteration, add current element of array as a new element to the end of given array
return new array

START

# Given an array of integers called "integers"

SET iterator = 0
SET new_array = []

While iterator < length of integers
  IF iterator is even or 0
    SET last element in new_array to the current iterated element of integers
  SET iterator = iterator = iterator + 1
RETURN new_array
